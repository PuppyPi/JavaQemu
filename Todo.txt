• See the version of qemu-img not working!
• Spaces in VM name!  (whyyyyyyyyyy is bash -c even being used at all!?! X'D )
• See the output(s)/error(s) shows message window twice!
• Message windows always being huge even when unnecessary XD''
• Only one running qemu process!?  But there can be multiple VM's!!
• Doesn't remember the qemu-executable-path/etc. configuration from last time X'D
• Doesn't reload VM configurations tabs!
• No warning on dropping unsaved changes!
• No warning on not saving before starting!
